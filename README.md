# VoltedPets - Minecraft Spigot Plugin

VoltedPets is a Spigot plugin that introduces a fun and engaging pet system to your Minecraft server. The plugin spawns little heads that follow the player, known as "pets." These pets can be given to users via a command and offer various abilities, such as boosting chances of item drops or providing other unique benefits.

Pets can be easily viewed and managed through a custom GUI, where only "UNLOCKED" pets can be selected for use. This plugin allows players to collect and utilize their pets, adding a new layer of excitement and customization to the gameplay experience.

Features:

- Pets follow the player as little heads
- Pets grant abilities or chances to gain items
- Custom GUI to view and select "UNLOCKED" pets
- Easy pet distribution via command

This plugin was originally developed as a commission, but the client has allowed me to share the code for portfolio purposes. Add VoltedPets to your server for a more immersive and rewarding experience!
